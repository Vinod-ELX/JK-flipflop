# JK-flipflop
**JK Flip-Flop Design and Simulation in Cadence Virtuoso**
This project implements a JK flip-flop at the transistor level using Cadence Virtuoso, one of the industry-leading tools for custom IC design. The design involves schematic creation, simulation, and validation using a testbench. The project demonstrates the behavior of a JK flip-flop under different input conditions with clock signals.
